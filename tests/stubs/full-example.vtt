00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.110
In this Larabit,

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.630
I'll give you some basic advice

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.170
for how to extract

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.860
interaction traits for your tasks.

5
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.200
It's a neat little pattern.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.520
And I'll give you an example.

7
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.460
If I switch this test class here,

8
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.530
actually what you're looking at

9
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.670
is part of the Laracasts code base.

10
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.350
And we're handling the changing of an email address,

11
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.940
which is simple, but actually for Laracasts,

12
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.760
a number of things need to happen

13
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.330
if you update your email.

14
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.320
For example,

15
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.380
yes, we have to update the record in the database,

16
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.640
but then we also need to record internal activity

17
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.500
that your email address has changed.

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.000
We also need to fire off an email to the original address

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.520
for the account, just as a security measure.

20
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.690
"Hey, heads-up your email address was changed.

21
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.320
If you didn't plan for this,

22
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.030
let us know and we'll have a look."

23
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.400
But then there's even other things,

24
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.660
like if you update your email address,

25
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
well, Laracasts will also update the email address

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.290
for your corresponding Stripe account.

27
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.090
And that is a third-party billing service.

28
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.050
So in other words, any Laracasts subscription

29
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.590
is hooked up to a Stripe customer account.

30
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.880
That's how that works.

31
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.600
So if you want to update your email address,

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.180
we should also update your Stripe email address on file to

33
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.930
make sure that any of those automatic receipts are sent to

34
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.970
the new address.

35
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.803
Right?

36
00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:17.400
Anyways, you get the idea.

37
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370
So let's have a quick look here.

38
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.030
It updates the email address.

39
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.863
All right.

40
00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.190
I've extracted this little signInEmail method,

41
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.170
very simple, create a user with a given email address,

42
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.460
sign them in and then return that user.

43
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.840
Super basic.

44
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.940
Okay.

45
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.320
So create an account with this email and sign it in.

46
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.350
Next, we're going to make a PATCH request

47
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.730
to update your account

48
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.000
and this corresponds to your settings page.

49
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.810
All right. Again, very simple.

50
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.610
So, let's try to update it to a new email address.

51
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.440
And as a result, if we refresh that user,

52
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.530
their email address should be the new one.

53
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.440
Again, super basic here.

54
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.273
We give it a run

55
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.180
and it passes. Okay.

56
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.600
But now let's scroll down to this other example.

57
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.690
It updates the Stripe customer

58
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.510
when an email address has changed.

59
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.230
Okay, let's see how we can make this work.

60
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.790
I'm going to begin by copying a lot of this,

61
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.950
but now I'm not interested in checking

62
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.610
the local email address.

63
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.280
I instead effectively want to make an API request to fetch

64
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.830
the customer on the Stripe end.

65
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.860
And then I check the email address.

66
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.690
So it sounds like I need to begin

67
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.610
by creating a subscription for this user

68
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.360
and reference the subscription,

69
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.890
and we're going to put them on the monthly accounts

70
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.313
and I will call create().

71
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.320
But now here's a little tricky thing.

72
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.940
In order to create a subscription,

73
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.380
we need a billing token to go along with it

74
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.600
and just think of this as a token

75
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.530
that represents a debit or credit card.

76
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.120
If we're going to put you on a monthly plan,

77
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.210
then we gotta bill your credit card, right?

78
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.740
So, how do I create a token when I'm not working with a

79
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.040
registration form; I'm instead working from a test?

80
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.830
Well, if I'm using Stripe,

81
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.740
we researched the documentation and they tell us,

82
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.310
use this token class that you get as part of their SDK.

83
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.330
We're going to create a new token.

84
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.476
When we do this, we give it a card

85
00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:09.600
and we just heard code the number.

86
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.600
So Stripe offers a test card of 4242424242424242.

87
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.980
Which is a generic test card number

88
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.790
that will always succeed.

89
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.660
I'll then set the expiration month.

90
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.950
We can just do one, expiration year.

91
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.800
I could hard code or I could do something like now()-&gt;addYear()

92
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.633
and then format it.

93
00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.750
I'm just going to do something far in the future.

94
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.830
And then of course we need a CVC number.

95
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.380
And again, these can be anything you want.

96
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.460
Okay. So now when I make this call,

97
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.030
it will actually make an API request to Stripe's server.

98
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.863
And that's fine.

99
00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:44.230
This is a feature test.

100
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.800
To be fully sure it works,

101
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.220
I need to interact with a real API.

102
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.987
So now I have a token,

103
00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:53.560
which means when I create a subscription

104
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.680
and then I update the account, as a side effect,

105
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.020
and I've already implemented this behind the scenes,

106
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.290
it should also update the email address on Stripe's end.

107
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.080
So here's how I do that with the Laracasts API,

108
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.660
get the user subscription,

109
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.230
and then I have a method to grab the

110
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.233
corresponding Stripe customer.

111
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.920
So again, this is going to make an API request

112
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.820
to build up a Stripe specific object

113
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.800
directly from their servers.

114
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.000
And then I can read the email address.

115
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.410
So let's go over this one more time

116
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.090
and then we'll run the test.

117
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.420
Create a generic accountant in Laracasts,

118
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.700
and then prepare a billing token

119
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.990
and use that token to register a subscription.

120
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.310
So that we'll upgrade their account on our end,

121
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.700
but it will also create a new Stripe customer.

122
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.260
Next, make a PATCH request

123
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.060
to update the user's email address,

124
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.210
like they might do from their settings page.

125
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.860
And if we did everything correctly,

126
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.830
if I then track down that Stripe customer

127
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.120
from their API,

128
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.910
the email address on file should match the new one

129
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.370
and not the old one.

130
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.980
So, if we give this a run, ooh, no API keeper.

131
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.980
Oh yeah, of course.

132
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.050
Why don't we quickly say Stripe,

133
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.364
and normally I have this isolated away,

134
00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:04.790
but I can use set API key

135
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.793
and this is in my config file.

136
00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:10.220
Okay. You can ignore that.

137
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.470
So, now if we run this,

138
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.635
what you'll see is,

139
00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:14.240
depending upon my connection,

140
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.710
this might take a little time,

141
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.720
and that's a real downside to this approach,

142
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.280
but it also gives you the assurance that your interaction

143
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.370
with the API actually works.

144
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.640
And that's actually pretty long in this case, eight seconds.

145
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.160
Usually, it's about half that time,

146
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.420
but even half is fairly long.

147
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.420
And it's just the penalty you pay to ensure that your

148
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.800
interaction with this API is what you expect.

149
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.830
So, here's what I usually do in these cases.

150
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.060
I will add an additional tag here.

151
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.047
I might say group API,

152
00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.170
and this will allow me to run my tests,

153
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.540
but exclude anything that touches a real API and that will

154
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.560
often be something I want.

155
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.393
Okay.

156
00:05:53.393 --> 00:05:56.300
But now what about any other test where I have to follow

157
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.630
this pattern here?

158
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.250
I don't want to repeat this code over and over.

159
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.210
So instead it would be nice if I could replace token

160
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.470
with a method call,

161
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.320
like createStripeToken().

162
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.520
So, let's begin by extracting this code here to a method,

163
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.143
createStripeToken(),

164
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.330
and then I can remove this call here.

165
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.163
Okay.

166
00:06:18.163 --> 00:06:22.875
So, now this will return a call to Token::create().

167
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.083
And that'll return a token.

168
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.150
Okay. That's refactor step number one.

169
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.200
So, if I come back and run this again

170
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.050
and fast forward a few seconds,

171
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.370
that works as well,

172
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.350
but we still haven't solved that case of needing

173
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.840
to create a Stripe token from other test classes.

174
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.930
So, the next step is going to be to refactor this method.

175
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.940
I will now grab this and extract it to a trait.

176
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.160
I can do this in my tests directory.

177
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.145
Let's create a new class

178
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:55.220
and actually it'll be a trait.

179
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.530
Now, I'm going to call it, InteractsWithStripe.

180
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.440
And I actually learned this naming convention from

181
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.530
Taylor Otwell, who is the creator of Laravel.

182
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.020
And I like it a lot.

183
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.300
If you need to extract reusable functionality that interacts

184
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.020
with all these different services,

185
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.810
they can all follow this same naming convention.

186
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.643
Okay.

187
00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:16.820
So, now I'll paste that method in, and reformat.

188
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.830
Okay.

189
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.620
The only remaining step is to

190
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.520
pull that in,

191
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.673
use InteractsWithStripe,

192
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.950
and then I'll add that as a trait.

193
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.220
Okay. So, if we did everything correctly,

194
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.470
let's give it another run

195
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.830
and it passes.

196
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.890
So, we have a more intuitive and

197
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.550
reusable approach here.

198
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.383
I like it.
